This is a full-stack coursework from my web development course. It is a mini version of the Yelp app. I developed a responsive website that allows users to search for business information and display relevant data. After completing this website, I also built a mini Android version of the Yelp app. Although this project is not the hardest project I have ever done, it is the first project that I started from scratch with no specific requirements or starter code. I had to figure it out on my own. I am providing this project as it is a good example to prove that I am a fast learner and passionate about programming.
